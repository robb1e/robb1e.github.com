We employed various dependency injection (DI) frameworks from Spring, Guice and a lightweight homegrow version. Now I’m at Pivotal Labs Spring is part of the family and some recent JVM projects combined with the recent release of Spring 4 means we’ve been looking at how these tools can help our clients.</div></article><article class="post pivotal"><h2 class="title"><a href="http://pivotallabs.com/discovery-and-framing-design-studio/">Discovery and framing: Design studio</a></h2><div class="date">20th September, 2013</div><div class="excerpt">‘Design studio’ is a simple exercise that can help derive workflows, surface new ideas, and help create a better understanding of the application and the problem at hand.

One of the changes most discussed is strong parameters and I wanted to explore some ideas about how to test this new feature. Strong parameters are a way of white listing HTTP query parameters and moves the burden of whitelisting from the ActiveModel/ActiveRecord classes and into the controllers. I think this feels like a better place for this to happen.</div></article><article class="post pivotal"><h2 class="title"><a href="http://pivotallabs.com/the-four-goals-every-project-should-aspire-to-have">Four goals every project should aspire to have</a></h2><div class="date">28th June, 2013</div><div class="excerpt">I did a presentation recently at NYU for their Summer Launchpad programme where I talked about prototyping and agile development.

It involves interaction a website your application does not control where that site could be anything with any number of dependencies on CSS or Javascript libraries. The first choice to make is trying to work with that website and probably setting an !important on every CSS selector used and hope that there’s no namespace or versioning clashes with any Javascript included; or use an iframe.</div></article><article class="post pivotal"><h2 class="title"><a href="http://pivotallabs.com/api-versioning/">API versioning</a></h2><div class="date">31st May, 2013</div><div class="excerpt">How to version an API has been a thoroughly discussed topic in the last several years regardless of protocol or approach, be that SOAP, REST or Hypermedia.

When this leak occurs a change to the application internals can ripple out and break clients of an API, or force applications to namespace URI paths which I feel is unnecessary and ugly.</div></article><article class="post pivotal"><h2 class="title"><a href="http://pivotallabs.com/stop-leaking-activerecord/">Stop leaking ActiveRecord throughout your application</a></h2><div class="date">6th May, 2013</div><div class="excerpt">Extending ActiveRecord::Base leaks a powerful API throughout an application which can lead to tempting code which breaks good design.

The documentation for how to route HTTP requests are comprehensive and give examples about photo resources within an application. If you’ve got photo and tag as first class resources of your application, Rails has you covered. But what if you are building an application with a focus on one type of resource, do you really want /resource_type as a prefix to all of your application paths? I certainly don’t and I’ll show you how to remove that without diverging from Rails core strenghts.</div></article><article class="post guardian"><h2 class="title"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/2011/oct/24/guardian-beta-blogpost">Guardian series reader</a></h2><div class="date">24th October, 2011</div><div class="excerpt">Notes on a Guardian hack day project</div></article><article class="post guardian"><h2 class="title"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/2011/oct/21/big-screen-experience">Guardian big screen experience</a></h2><div class="date">21st October, 2011</div><div class="excerpt">Notes on a Guardian hack day project</div></article><article class="post personal"><h2 class="title"><a href="http://blog.iclutton.com/2011/09/notes-from-schema-design-at-scale.html">Notes from 'Schema design at scale'</a></h2><div class="date">19th September, 2011</div><div class="excerpt">Notes from the presentation</div></article></section><section class="Presentations__list"><h1>Presentations</h1><p class="Presentations__presentation--link"><a href="/talk/prototyping-and-agile-development-pivotal-boulder">Prototyping and agile development @ Denver Startup Week 2013</a></p><p class="Presentations__presentation--link"><a href="/talk/prototyping-and-agile-development">Prototyping and agile development @ NYU Summer Launchpad Speaker Series 2013</a></p><p class="Presentations__presentation--link"><a href="/talk/sustainable-small-architecture">Sustainable small architecture @ QCon, London 2013</a></p><p class="Presentations__presentation--link"><a href="/talk/getting-your-confidence-back">Getting your confidence back @ London Ruby User Group (LRUG) 2013</a></p><p class="Presentations__presentation--link"><a href="/talk/sustainable-bdd">Sustainable BDD @ LA Ruby Conf, 2013</a></p><p class="Presentations__presentation--link"><a href="/talk/api-patterns-and-practices">API patterns and practices @ Hacks and Hackers meetup</a></p><p class="Presentations__presentation--link"><a href="/talk/callflow">Callflow @ Osmosoft Show and Tell, 2008</a></p></section></div></body></html>
